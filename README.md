## Recommendations

### Enhanced Clearance Rate Strategies
- **Resource Allocation:** Allocate additional resources to districts with high unresolved cases, particularly the ED district.
- **Technology Integration:** Leverage predictive analytics to expedite the case clearance process.

### Targeted Patrol and Surveillance
- **Peak Hour Patrols:** Increase surveillance during the peak crime hours from **17:00 to 18:00**, focusing on homes and highways.
- **Infrastructure Improvements:** Install additional CCTV cameras and improve lighting in high-crime zones.

### Community Engagement
- **Family Violence Prevention:** Conduct awareness campaigns targeting family violence incidents.
- **Community Partnerships:** Collaborate with NGOs and schools to educate the public and support victims.

## Future Enhancements
- **Automation:** Create scripts for automated data updates.
- **Predictive Analysis:** Use machine learning to forecast crime rates and hotspot zones.
